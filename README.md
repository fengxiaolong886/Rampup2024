# Ramp up2024
As years passed, I should be back to coding for more interesting world explore. It's not easy for these years, many roles transferred for life. It's forced to learn new skill and ignore what I have. The world go ahead so rapidly and seems not easy to catch it. I hope I can catch the tail this time. 

## Way forward plan:
AP:
1. Follow the guide to travel with basic python, data analysis methods.
    W28D6: Done
2. Learn more about the data visualization method.
    W28D6: Done  
4. Coding for machine learning basic alogrithm.
    W28D6: Ongoing
6. Review my previous deep learning code and RL code

7. Leetcode for basic alogrithms.

8. Follow kaggle best practice.
