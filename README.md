# Ramp up 2024
As years passed, I should be back to coding for more interesting world explore. It's not easy for these years, many roles transferred for life. It's forced to learn new skill and ignore what I have. The world go ahead so rapidly and seems not easy to catch it. I hope I can catch the tail this time. 

## Action plan of Way forward: <br/>
Closed:
1. Closed: Follow the guide to travel with basic python, data analysis methods.<br/> 
   W28D6: Done <br/>
2. Closed:  Learn more about the data visualization method. <br/>
   W28D6: Done   <br/>
3. Closed: Leetcode for basic algorithms. Target 200 pcs in 30 days. <br/>
   Go forward with algorithm type, <br/>
        Summary:<br/>
        a. Task completed in 20 days (from W29D1 to W31D6).<br/>
        b. Most of random part is easy mode.<br/>
        c. Not structure learning during the task implementation.<br/>
        d. Way forward: daily 2-3 cases for medium level and pay more effort on other tasks.<br/>
        e. Good job for me for ramp up in servel years diving into other job area. You can do more and improve yourself in more efficiency way!<br/>
        <br/>          
4. Closed: Review my previous deep learning code and RL code <br/>
   W31D6: Cancel this part as new task assigned for structure learn for ML, DL and RL. <br/>
5. Closed: Coursera: Deep learning, total:  P180, target complete it before W35D7<br/>
   DoD:  complete all the video course.  complete all the code assignment.<br/>
   Summary: task done from W33D5 to W36D2.<br/>

Pending:
6. Visualization method learn.<br/>
7. Follow Kaggle best practice. Follow at least 10 cases. <br/>
   W28D5: Pending on task 6,  leetcode task. Postpone. <br/>
   W32D1:  Postpone<br/>
8. Quantitative analysis warm up. <br/>
    W28D5: Pending on task 6,  leetcode task. Postpone. <br/>
   W32D1:  Postpone<br/>

Ongoing:
9. Coding for DL/ML basic algorithm. <br/>
   W37D4:  ongoing<br/>
10. Read two ML books.<br/>
    W37D4: ongoing
11. Rampup for basic math:
    a. Calculus --Done
    b. Linear Agebra --Ongoing
    c. Probability 
    
## Daily task:<br/>
1. Daily leetcode start from W31D7 and target is at least two medium level per day .
    W38d4: total 7 <br/>
