# Ramp up2024
As years passed, I should be back to coding for more interesting world explore. It's not easy for these years, many roles transferred for life. It's forced to learn new skill and ignore what I have. The world go ahead so rapidly and seems not easy to catch it. I hope I can catch the tail this time. 

## Way forward plan:
AP:
1. Follow the guide to travel with basic python, data analysis methods.
    W28D6: Done
2. Learn more about the data visualization method.
    W28D6: Done  
3. Coding for machine learning basic alogrithm.
    W28D6: 
4. Review my previous deep learning code and RL code
   
5. Leetcode for basic alogrithms. Target 200 pcs in 30 days.
   
6. Follow kaggle best practice. Follow at leat 10 cases.
   
7. Quantitative analysis warm up.
