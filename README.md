# Ramp up2024
As years passed, I should back to coding for more interesting world explore.

It's not easy for these years,  many roles transferred for life. It's forced to learn new skill and ignore what I have. 

The world go ahead so rapidly and seems not easy to catch it. I hope I can catch the tail this time.

W28D2:  two days rampup, seems everythong goes well.
